== Installation ==

Installing the Business Hours Indicator plugin is very easy:

1. Install from the WordPress Dashboard > Plugin page
2. Or manually download the plugin and extract to wp-content/plugins/
3. Activate the plugin
4. Go to Wordpress Dashboard > Settings > Business Hours Indicator
5. Enter your location, daily opening hours, and fiddle with more settings if you want
6. Use the shortcode `[mbhi location="my location"]` to display the output on pages or posts
7. Or use the PHP code `do_shortcode('[mbhi location="my location"]')` to display the output anywhere in your theme


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does these shortcodes need extra options? =

Yes, at least 1. You should give it a 'location' attribute. If you don't, the first location is used.

= How can I style the business hours overview? =

The code exposes enough CSS classes to give you many styling options. You can
find all classes [here](https://businesshourplugin.maartenbelmans.com/docs/free-documentation/styling/all-exposed-css-classes/).
